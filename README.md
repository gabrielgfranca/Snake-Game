# SnakeGame
This game was developed to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and introduce concepts such as class hierarchy and `.txt` file manipulation, used here to store the player's high score.  

### Objetivo  
The goal of the game is simple: collect apples to increase your score while avoiding collisions with the screen edges or your own tail.  

### Como funciona?  
- **Score:** Displays your current score, which increases with each apple collected.  
- **HighScore:** Stores your highest score and updates only if you beat the previous record.  
- If you collide with the edges or your tail, your Score is reset, but the HighScore remains saved.   

### Caracter√≠sticas  
- Implementation of class hierarchy to manage game objects.  
- Reading and writing `.txt` files to store the HighScore.  
- Simple and functional interface in Python.
